# metaCCA
The MATLAB codes in this repository can be used to perform metaCCA <br />
(and its variant metaCCA+) - summary statistics-based analysis <br />
of a single or multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS) <br />
that allows multivariate representation of both genotype and phenotype.

example.m demonstrates the usage of metaCCA. Test files are provided.
